# tetris
simple webgl tetris game

IMPLEMENTATION
1. the colors of the game change everytime you reload it. you shoulnÂ´d miss that!
2. instead of implementing r,l,d,u i implemented the w,a,s,d keys as an alternative to the arrow keys, because the r,l,d,u set of keys is not really playable. 

LIBRARIES AND SOURCES
1. i used the code structure of the "learning webgl tutorial" and adapted it for my needs. here there is the link: http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217
2. also i use: glmatrix.js and webgl-utils.js
